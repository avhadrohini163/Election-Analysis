# Election-Analysis
Module 3 (Python) - Election Analysis
## Project Overview
A colorado Board of election employee has given the following tasks to complete the elction audit of a recent loacal congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received the votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of election based on popular vote.

- Software: Python 3.9, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.1.3

## Summary
The Analysis of the Election:
- There were total 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8%  of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Candidate Diana DeGette, who received 73.8%  of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
- The complete Python 3.9 code result for candidates is given in below image.

## Challenge Overview 
The election commision has requested additional data to complete the audit. The additional tasks were:

1. The voter turnout for each county.
2. The complete list of total counties which were considered in this election audit.
3. The total number of votes generated in this election audit.
4. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
5. The county with highest turnout.

## Challenge Result
The Analysis of the election show that:
- There were total 369,711 votes cast in the election.

- The counties were:
    - Jefferson
    - Denver
    - Arapahoe

- The county results were:
    - Jefferson county received 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 number of votes.
    - Denver county received 82.8%  of the vote and 306,055 number of votes.
    - Arapahoe county received 6.7% of the vote and 24,801 number of votes.
    
- The county with the largest turnout was Denver with 82.8 % of vote and 306,055 number of votes.
- The complete Python 3.9 code result is given in below image.

## Challenge Summary:
This way the script can be used for any number of counties and candidates.
However the after careful considerations the code still can be modified in at least two areas.
    1. The script could be modified to get total number of votes generated from each county for each candidate to get an idea of which county geneararted 
       more votes for each candidate.
    2. The results could be structured in a table format by modifying the script to easily capture the election audit summary.
